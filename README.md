# Synthetic Signal Generation Using Spline-Based Method

This repository presents a spline-based method for synthetic signal generation, designed to overcome the limitations of traditional and GAN-based approaches. The method allows precise control over frequency, amplitude, phase, and noise levels, offering a flexible and powerful approach for signal modeling.

Key features of this method include:
- **Non-uniform partitioning** and **spline interpolation** to generate signals that are both statistically consistent and adaptable to various experimental needs.
- Robust **spectral stability analysis** and **noise evaluation** to assess the quality and reliability of the generated signals.
- Successful application in **neural network-based signal reconstruction tasks**, demonstrating the versatility of the method.

This work provides a **reproducible and scalable framework** for synthetic data generation. The generated signals have been successfully applied in diverse fields, including:
- Biomedical analysis
- Financial forecasting
- Industrial monitoring

The repository includes the implementation of this method, along with example code and datasets, making it easy to integrate and apply in your own projects.
